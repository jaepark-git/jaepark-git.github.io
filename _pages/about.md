I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University, with a strong commitment to advancing machine learning through both rigorous research and practical application. My primary research focus lies in **trustworthy AI**, particularly in debiasing **multimodal systems**. I explore post-hoc approaches that mitigate fairness issues in large vision-and-language models, aiming to ensure equitable performance across demographic groups without the need for retraining. I am also interested in machine learning under limited data settings, including positive-unlabeled learning and novel category discovery, to enable robust learning in data-scarce environments.

In addition to my academic research, I pursue industrial applications of machine learning, such as developing generative models for inverse problems in antenna design and building datasets and foundational models for industrial sound AI. These efforts reflect my broader goal of connecting methodological advancements with practical impact across diverse engineering domains.
